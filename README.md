2. **Install and setup the [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) and [discord.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js) packages**
3. Add the endpoint url in your bot's panel (https://dsc.best/dashboard/bot/YOUR-BOT-ID-HERE) of dsc.best

const Client = new Discord.Client({
	intents: [Discord.Intents.FLAGS.GUILDS, 
	Discord.Intents.FLAGS.GUILD_MESSAGES] //Only add intents if you work in v13
})

const { WebhookAPI } = require('dsc-functions') // import the package
const express = require('express')
const app = express()

app.use(express.json())
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }))

client.on('ready', () => {
	console.log('Online!')
})

const dscWebhook = new WebhookAPI(Client, { ApiToken: 'YOUR-DSC-BEST-BOT-API-TOKEN' }) // add the discord client and the dsc.best api token of your bot

app.post('/endpointname', (req, res) => {
	const info = dscWebhook.getWebhookData(req)
	
	const webhookEmbed = new Discord.MessageEmbed()
	.setDescription(`${info.username} has voted, and now i have ${info.votes} votes`)
	
	dscWebhook.sendWebhook(webhookEmbed, {
		channelId: '856544223801245736', // Here goes the id the channel where you want to send the embed
		reaction: 'ðŸ’Ÿ', // Reaction not required (reaction unicode), support animated, normal and custom emojis
		discordJSVersion: 'v13' //We support v12 too (if you are a v13 user this line is optional)
	})
